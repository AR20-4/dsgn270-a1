### Website Critique for Fleur De Sel

#### By: Rcahel Glagsow 

[Fleur De Sel/Flower of Salt ](https://www.fleurdeselbrasserie.com)




Did you know that most people research a restaurant’s website before they decide to visit that restaurant? That means restaurants are judged heavily by the impression that is imposed on the quality and usability of their website before they have a chance for a potential guest to judge them based on their merits. 


Knowing this consider a restaurant’s website as the first impression a potential guest has of that restaurant. It sets guests’ expectations of what it’s like to dine at that restaurant. Therefore it’s vital for a restaurant to have an effective website and give their potential guest a positive experience while on the restaurants’ site. 


Having said that, the website for Fleur De Sel makes the otherwise elegant and classically French restaurant seem garish and low quality. When visiting the website the first issue is that it takes quite a while for the page to fully load. It took over 5 seconds to interact with meaningful content. Then once the page is fully displayed you can notice there are several visual hierarchy conventions that are broken such as:


* __Color and Contrast__ 

* __Perspective__

* __Size and Scale__

* __Proximity__

* __Negative Space__

* __Typography__


Visual hierarchy is a very important design fundamental. Proper visual hierarchy conventions should be followed to successfully have a “good” and effective website. 


> Here are the reasons Fleur De Sel failed in meeting the proper design fundamentals of visual hierarchy. 

### Color and Contrast


> In the top navigation bar, we find bright yellow text against a white background. The major issue with the color choice of yellow text against a white background, as it portrays to contrast, is low readability. The color contrast ratio of a color like yellow is about 1 whereas, for the color black, it has a score of 21 when against a white background. 

> If people can’t read the text in the navigation bar then it’s harder to navigate and utilize the website.  We actually see this low visibility and low contrast ratio issue throughout the entire website.


### Perspective 


> The problem with perspective on this website is the lack of contrast. The choice of yellow and white text over the static brick wall image makes it very difficult to read. There is also this strange highlight drop shadow effect they gave the yellow and white text, which makes the text fuzzy and thus harder to read.  


### Size and Scale


> This convention, in my opinion, needs a few tweaks on the Fleur De Sel page. In general, the font sizing is not distinct enough to give me a good sense of importance. The text in the top navigation bar could be larger. The size of the font on the home page that states information about hours, phone number, and messaging is appropriate, whereas the font size for the same type of contact information on the actual contact page seems less so. 


### Proximity  


> The entire hero section is proximity challenged. The logo creeps up into the navigation menu, and there’s a social media button floating like a buoy. Even though the site tries to go for a tile theme, the spacing feels smooshed. 


### Negative space 


> The feeling that this site is smooshed and that there’s too much to look at has to do with its lack of negative space. 


### Typography 


> Lastly the font choices for most of the body of the site lack consistency. This lack of congruency on the page makes it hard to follow, then couple that with the lack of negative space as well as poor scale and a visitor to this site is now confused and doesn’t know where the focus is.

**There are 3 concepts we can employ to make this website better.**

_What is the crucial information a potential guest would desire from a website for a restaurant?_


*  __Contact Information__

Guests visiting restaurants’ websites should be able to find important information about the restaurant easily. 

* __Menu as PDF__

A visitor at a restaurants’ web page should never have to download a PDF. The menu should be legible with a good description of what the item is. 

* __Have good images of your food__

Fleur De Sel has great images of their food on their google page but not on their actual web page. This is a missed opportunity to showcase how upscale and delicious their food looks. 

* __Online ordering (or at least online reservations) should be an option__

Make it easy for your guests to order and your amount of orders will increase. It’s a simple way to grow your business it takes a little work up front to set it up but then it pays for its self. 


* __Images of the restaurant’s interior__

Everyone loves pictures, they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Show potential guests what the look and feel of the restaurant is like. 

* __Have an“about” section__

What makes this restaurant stand out? Aside from classifying the type of food the restaurant servers what else makes the restaurant unique? Fleur De Sel is a French restaurant but there was no about section on their page to tell me more about their style of cooking or how they pair their courses or even if the restaurant is a Calgary staple? As part of their logo, there is a year date of 1998, if they have been around for over 20 years, tell the visitor more about the legacy of the restaurant. 

* __A website theme that matches your restaurant’s style__
